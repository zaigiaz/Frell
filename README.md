# Overview
This is an implementation of a shell in C, I want to support basic File and Directory commands for now on linux
and later on do more complicated shell commands

# TODO:
TODO: add cwd command to get current directory
TODO: use fork() to execute commands as child processes
TODO: add command line flag parsing
